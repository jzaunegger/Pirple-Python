# Notes on Variables in Python
* Variables are basic data structures that allow you to save information and use it.
* Variables are the component to the left of the equal sign, the value to the right is the information that the variable stores. 
* Variables allow you to save and reuse pieces of data over and over again. You can also over-write the value of any variable
by reassigning the value, the same way you create a variable in the first place.

## Examples:
* One = 1
* Two = 2
* Three = 3
* Decimal = 1.1

* A shorthand method of assigning mulitple variables in a single line.
	* one, two, three = 1, 2, 3

* Methods for updating a variables value
	* One = 1     		--> 1	
	* One = One + 1		--> 2
	* One += 1 			--> 3

## Variable Types:
* Numbers (Integers, Doubles and Floats or Decimal Numbers)
* Strings (A series of characters)
* Characters 
* Booleans

## Types of Variables
* Local: Variables that exist in the space of a function or a class. They are only accessible for the chunk of code that they are created in.
* Global: Variables that are not in a function or class and can be accessed from anywhere in the code. Great usage for constants. (You can type the word "global" in front of the variable name to specify that the variable is a global variable, however this is not required)
