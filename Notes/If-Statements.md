# If Statements and Conditional Statements

* If Statements use conditional logic to evaluate data. For example saying 5 < 10 would evaluate to true, but 5 > 10 would evaluate to false. Another example would be if 5 < 10 and 20 < 100 this would also evaluate to true. They allow developers to use conditonal logic and special keyword operations. If statements also allows you to use else if and else statements in conjunction with if.

* Much like loops and functions if statments are sensitive to whitespace indenting and using a colon to denote where the statement ends. 

* Overall Syntax
```python

    if condition:
        # actions goes here

    elif:
        # Else If action goes here

    else:
        # Else action goes here

```

## Conditional Logic
* >     : Greater Than
* >=    : Greater Than or Equal To
* ==    : Is Equal To
* <=    : Less Than or Equal To
* <     : Less Than
* and   : Performs a and operation on two conditional statements
* or    : Performa a or operation on two conditional statements
