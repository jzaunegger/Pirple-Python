# Pirple-Python
My Github Repo from Pirples Python-Is-Easy Course. This repository has a series of notes from the course, homework assingments, and projects completed from this course. This repository is more informationally based and is intended to be used as a reference for things related to Python3. I plan on adding further examples
and notes as my knowledge and usage of Python further develops.

My editor that I am using is Visual Studio Code in Ubuntu with the Bash Terminal. It makes development and execution nice and easy.
